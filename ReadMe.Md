Follow the directions below!

1. On line 1 of the JavaScript, declare a variable called `name`. Give it the value of your name. **Remember:** This is a string so the value should be in quotes ""! 

2. On line 2 of the JavaScript declare a variable called `age`. Give it the value of your age. **Remember:** This is a number, so the value does not have to be in quotes!

3. On line 3 of the JavaScript, declare a variable called `answer` which saves the `div` on line 8 of the HTML. Use `document.querySelector`!


When you're done, remove the comment backslashed from line 4 and see the answer on screen!
